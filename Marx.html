<h2>Overall intruduction</h2>
<p>Hegel (1770–1831) was a German philosopher who significantly influenced Western philosophy, particularly through his ideas on dialectics, history, and absolute idealism. <br>His work emphasized the development of self-consciousness and the unfolding of reason throughout history.</p>
<br>
<h2>Marx's major contributions include:</h2>
<br>
<ul><li>The Communist Manifesto: Co-authored with Friedrich Engels, it outlines the necessity of proletarian revolution, calling on the working class to unite, <br>overthrow capitalism, and establish a socialist society.</li>
<li>Capital: A comprehensive analysis of capitalist economics, where he introduced the theory of surplus value, <br>revealing the nature of capital accumulation and the exploitation of workers.
</li>
<li>Historical Materialism: The theory that history is driven by material production methods, with class struggle as the engine of social development, predicting the eventual collapse of capitalism and the rise of communism.</li></ul>

<h2>Economic relationship in Marx view</h2>
<p>In Marx's theory,capital society manufacture stuff by formular: primitive materials+labor force= product.<br>
And in normal trading, the price of product is higher than the cost of <primitive materials+ labor force>that produce surplus value.<br>
Otherwise, the main force of buy produced stuff is still working class who supply labor,<br>
and the capical class would own more profit as they have extra fee to build up new production circuit.</p>

<h2>Marxism</h2>
<p>Depands on the content above, you might find that theorical capital class seem gain the most interest without produce any social value,which is unfair to others.<br>
And most of time data shows yield of human manufacture product is enough to everyone, at least no one would suffer in poverty.<br>
In the other hand,why don't people take off those group of person who gain the most value and purchase equality of all and predominate social resource by the working class.<br>
In his theories,the capitalism society would transform into socialism society, and would finally transform into commonism.<br>
The characteristics of those two forms of societies would seem bit of radical that huge different from now, like commonism society are tends to become Atheism and Anarchism.<br>
Actually, Marx had been strongly influenced by Hegel, but Marx had changed somethings, especially their view point to history, Hegel is Absolute Idealist, and Marx is materialism.<br>
Marx believe history are processed by human being instead of kinds of fatalism.Those above can also known as Marx's own change to the dialectics</p>
