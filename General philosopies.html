<h2>What is philosopy/How to define philosopy?</h2>
<p>It's a tricky and complex problem to define philosopy. Philosopy is basically all kinds of theories in almost all fields, <br>which includes scince, morality, ideology and maybe also doctines of religions, <br>and most of time science are individually discussed.<br> It's changable as it could be various perspectives.</p>

<h2>The left/right-wind</h2>
<p>The leftwind and rightwind are general words to describe tendencies of perpectives on certain event.<br>
Leftwinds are trends to To reduce social injustice, the gap between the rich and the poor and the imbalance of power.<br>
Examples of leftwind behavior can be: Social equality, government economic intervention, diversity and inclusion, and environmentalism.<br> It can be decribed as progressivism and sometime staggered with radicalism<br>
Rightwind are the opposite of the left, <br>it tends to be personal freedom, traditional moral values, limited government intervention, and personal responsibility tend to be conservative and maintain the existing social order.<br>
Examples of rightwind can be: nationalism and free economy.<br>
Both of those can be extreme, which cause tragedies though human history. Examples of extreme rightwind event can be: <br>The Nazi's Nationalism(Aryan Superman; Anti-Semitism);<br>Right Zionism(take back land from foreign nations with religous reason).<br>
Examples of extreme leftwind events: Khmer Rouge(Massive violence, which killed around 2m of Cambodian); Internationalism.<br>Something noticable is leftwind can be more extreme than the right as we started from the rightwind.</p>

<h2>How we are different from surrounding?</h2>
<p>Everyone know that human is actually still kind of animals, but how do we different from others ?<br> The main difference is significant, we got intellgence, so we built up complex tools and finding rules between everythings.<br>The lives are kinds of accidental produced, which produces a new atomsphere seem contain more rules.<br>What do we need to do and the sense of final is always a problem long-lasted classic question. <br>For most of living things, the main purpose is to produce next generation. But for us, we need to find something else</p>
