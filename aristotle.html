<h5>Overall intruduction</h5>
<p>Aristotle (384–322 BCE) was a Greek philosopher who shaped Western thought with his work in logic, ethics, politics, and science.<br> A student of Plato, he focused on empirical observation and categorized knowledge. <br>His concept of the "golden mean" in ethics and his influential works like Metaphysics and Politics continue to impact philosophy and science.<br>He had made those great works below:<br><ul><li>Metaphysics: Explores questions of existence, causality, and the nature of reality.</li><li>
Nicomachean Ethics: Discusses what it means to live a good life and introduces the concept of the "golden mean," advocating for virtue as the balance between extremes.</li><li>
Politics: Examines the nature of human communities, the best forms of government, and how societies should be organized for the common good.</li><li>
Poetics: Analyzes literary theory, particularly tragedy and epic poetry.</li><ul>

<h5>Personal summarized core ideas</h5>
<h2>Generally, dream,hope and lifes had made objective meaning and truth outside of us,<br></h2> <p>Meanwhile, dream,hope and lifes inside of our heart had created meaning and truth in our heart relatively<br><br></p><h2>What makes fortunates and pleasure</h2><p>
From Aristotle's theory, the "good-life" people are purchasing are formed by three main factors, which were material wealth, purchasing honor, and satisfying bodily pleasures.<br>

<h5>Relationship with other Ancient Greeks</h5>
<p>Except Aristotle, you might also heard of two Greeces that became well-known with their philosophy————Socrates and Plato<br>
Aristotle was student of Plato, and Plato was student of Socrates.<br>
And basically, we can understand Socrates's promotion is state kind of logic to think of theories by Critical Thinking and Essentialism;<br>
Plato had produced a suit of ideology based on impact of Socrates, and further expanded Socrates's theory with create the Metaphysics;<br>
And Aritotle had partly adapted from Plato and produced ideology similar to the Empiricism and made some actual application which stated the basics of several science fields.
