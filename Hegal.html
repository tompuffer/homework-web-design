<h2>Overall intruduction</h2>
<p>Hegel (1770–1831) was a German philosopher who significantly influenced Western philosophy, particularly through his ideas on dialectics, history, and absolute idealism. <br>His work emphasized the development of self-consciousness and the unfolding of reason throughout history.</p>
<br>Hegel's major contributions include:<br><ul><li>Phenomenology of Spirit: Examines the development of human consciousness and self-awareness through a dialectical process, culminating in absolute knowledge.</li><li>
Science of Logic: Explores the principles of logic and the nature of reality, introducing the dialectical method as a way of understanding contradictions.<li>Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences: A comprehensive overview of his philosophical system, covering logic, nature, and spirit, articulating the progression of knowledge and reality.</li>
<li>Philosophy of History: Analyzes the unfolding of history as a rational process, asserting that history has a purpose and moves toward the realization of freedom.</li>

<h2>Infinate and finate</h2>
<h5>Quatation of infinate and finate</h5><br>
<p>"The infinite as my object is the nonfinite, the nonparticular, the nonlimited, the universal generally. <br>
The finite is posited in relation to the infinite as the negative or the dependent, that which evaporates in relationship to the infinite.<br>
The infinite is posited as the substantial, the not-dependent; the finite [as] what has no subsistence, or [rather] has its subsistence only through its relationship to the infinite. <br>
In their being brought together, a unity arises through the sublation of one side, namely of the finite, which cannot hold out against the infinite."</p><br>
Depands by my own understanding, finate stands for all single events or things acting within our cognition, that's based on certain field which was the universe.<br>
And the cognition would keep developing by certain dialectics based on the aggression between finate and infinate and finally tends to the tends which is the end.</p>

<h2>Furthermore summrized theories</h2>
<p>Depands on the defination of infinate and finate above, we could find several core theories of Hegel's ideologies.<br>
For example, the development of finate are retional and absolute and expected to be grown by the mentioned dialectics, and finally leads to the freedom,<br>
just like the history, some well-known person's work are the sum of history at all, just like some kinds of analysis believe that German would struggle after the WWI(Hitler's leadership)<br>
In conclusion, Hegel believe everythings would finally leads to the freedom by an absolute process of development, which was retional, expected and Idealism.<br>
Otherwise, I havn't mentioned his theories of personal mental development that I just heard during research that had similar or same characteristics with the dialecte.</p>
